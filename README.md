## Description
This application was created for users who want to create a Readme in their terminal rather than having to hardcode it. It is a fun and creative way of doing things. The application will allow users to create it anytime they have a project.

## Installation
You will need to install the following. 1. Vscode 2. Node Js and 3. Inquirer 8.2.4 package in node.
## Usage
The usage of my project is simple, once all the following applications are installed, users can simply use "node ." to run in the command line, after that the questions will prompt up and they will simply answer the questions accordingly. After all the questions are answered a professional README will then be generated.
